Exercise: Number

Write a program which has a user guess a random number between 1 and 100.

Replace the comments that are in all caps with your code to make the program work.

#!/usr/bin/env python

from __future__ import print_function

import sys
import random

if sys.version_info[0] > 2:
    INPUT = input
else:
    INPUT = raw_input


def get_guess():
    """
    Ask user for their guess
    """

    try:
        guess = int(INPUT("What is your guess? "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Come on, integers only.")
        return get_guess()
    return guess

# Set up random number generator
randomGen = random.SystemRandom()

# Get number between 1 and 100
number = randomGen.randint(1, 100)

# Print Instructions
print("\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTry to figure it out in five guesses.\n")

# Ask the user for their guess until they get it right or run out of guesses
# YOUR CODE HERE
# THE NUMBER IS AVAILABLE IN THE number VARIABLE
# USE THE get_guess() FUNCTION TO RETRIEVE THE USER'S GUESSES
