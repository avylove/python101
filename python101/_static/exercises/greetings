Exercise: Greetings

The following program asks the user for their name and will print a custom statement for certain users based on their name. For all other users, it has a default statement. Pressing enter without entering a name will exit.

Replace the comments that are in all caps with your code to make the program work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#! FIX THIS LINE
# Complete the shebang line above

# Use the print function from Python 3
# ADD THE APPROPRIATE IMPORT LINE HERE

import sys
if sys.version_info[0] > 2:
    INPUT = input
else:
    INPUT = raw_input

# YOU DON'T HAVE TO, BUT YOU CAN PUT CODE HERE IF YOU WANT

while True:

    # Get name
    name = INPUT("What is your name? ")

    # If no name is given, exit
    if not name:
        break

    # Name should always start with a capital letter
    formattedName =  # YOUR CODE HERE

    # Determine which statement to use, statements are below
    # This should work the same regardless of capitalization
    statement =  # YOUR CODE HERE

    print('Hi, %s! %s' % (formattedName, statement))

# Statements to output for specific users
# Bob - How about that local sports team?
# Sally - If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?
# Terry - Do you know the way to San Jose?
# Graham - I'll have the spam and eggs.
# Jane - I'll have the green eggs and spam.
# anyone else - What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
